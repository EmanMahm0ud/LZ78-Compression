# LZ78-Compression

This project compresses a file with lz78 algorithm.

You can see three files:-
1- data.txt       --> contains a simple data to be compressed
2- compressed.txt --> contains tags after compressing
3- data2.txt      --> conatins original file data after decompressing tags

You can try to compress large file (100 kb or larger) and you will see that compressed.txt size is smaller than the original size file.
